Step 6
½ c brandy or ½ c brandy & rum	 After fruit cake has cooled, wrap in cheesecloth. Place on piece of aluminum foil and pour ¼ to ½ cup of liquor over each cake.  Wrap tightly in foil so that cakes can be turned without the liquor spilling.  Keep on counter and turn them over every day for two weeks.  This keeps the cakes moist, and also keeps them from developing a soggy spot.  May be
kept in the refrigerator or freezer.
